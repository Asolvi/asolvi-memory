# React workshop

## Requirements

### Node.js

Get Node.js with npm version 6 or higher [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Yarn

In these training sessions, we will use yarn. You can install yarn through npm:
`npm install -g yarn`

If you want to, you can also just keep using npm.

## Running the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Add dependencies in `package.json` (e.g. @material-ui) and then run `yarn install`.
This needs to be done every time you update your dependencies.

Start the server by running the command:
`yarn start`

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and contains everything that JavaScript contains. The rationale for using TypeScript is to have less runtime errors, since the compiler can tell you when you have type mismatches.
The errors will often be visible in e.g. VS Code, even before starting the program.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More
